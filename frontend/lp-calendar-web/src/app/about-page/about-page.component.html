<h1>About this page</h1>
<p>This page is a project made by Linkin Park fans to keep track of all the shows in different timezones. With over 60 shows around the world in 2025, things can get confusing. That's why this project shows you all the shows in your local and also the venue's timezone.</p>

<h2>Calendar feed</h2>
<p>Many calendar applications (like on iOS, iPadOS and macOS) support calendar subscription. This project publishes a calendar feed with all the shows that you can use in your calendar app.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Who is behind this project?</h3>
<p>This project was started by <a href="https://github.com/FelixSFD" target="_blank" class="link-secondary link-offset-2 link-underline-opacity-25 link-underline-opacity-100-hover">FelixSFD</a> to learn new technologies and get an overview of all shows in his local timezone.</p>

<h3>Do I need to create an account?</h3>
<p>No. At the moment, the accounts are only used by administrators to manage the concert data.</p>

<h3>How can I contribute?</h3>
<p>At the moment, the page is still in early development.</p>
<p>In the future, select users might be added as administrators to manage the concert list. You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/FelixSFD/lp-concerts-feed" target="_blank" class="link-secondary link-offset-2 link-underline-opacity-25 link-underline-opacity-100-hover">GitHub</a>, but at the moment, there are no contributions needed as there is not a clear plan for the project yet.</p>

<h3>Can I use the data?</h3>
<p><b>Yes!</b> The data is supposed to be public. If you have questions about the APIs (warning, they might change as they are in early development!), feel free to contact FelixSFD on Discord.</p>

<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p>The frontend is hosted as an Angular single-page-application in an AWS S3 bucket behind a CloudFront distribution for caching and having a custom domain.</p>
<p>Backend logic and the database is hosted in AWS. The database is a DynamoDB while the logic for reading and writing is implemented in AWS Lambda functions running .NET 8. The API is cached by AWS CloudFront.</p>
<p>To generate the calendar feed, one API endpoint creates an iCal file that contains all the concerts using the <a href="https://github.com/ical-org/ical.net" target="_blank" class="link-secondary link-offset-2 link-underline-opacity-25 link-underline-opacity-100-hover">iCal.NET</a> library. When you subscribe to the calendar, your calendar application contacts our server regularly to get an updated file.</p>

<h4>Where does the data for the map come from?</h4>
<p>Each location on the map was manually selected and saved to our database. The map itself is from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org" target="_blank" class="link-secondary link-offset-2 link-underline-opacity-25 link-underline-opacity-100-hover">OpenStreetMap</a>.</p>

<h3>Where can I find the history of past concerts?</h3>

  This page is intended for <i>future</i> concerts.
